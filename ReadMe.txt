On ver 1.1, we have simplified and updated with global varible file for rd-import. As it was complex before and there was probability of error while 
feeling the values on the sheet. It will save almost 80% of the time while feeling the file. But the general.properties template
file needs to be verified with new / old processes that needs to be added or removed as per requirement from a rage modeler.

We have also added scripts which will not require developers time to copy, paste, zip artefacts, softwares etc.. on standard format on new VM's. Which 
previously would have takedn one day as copying would take lot of time from ftp server. Now this scripts would take care of it
provided the same ususal standard and agreed naming convention have been used to maintain artefacts at ftp.
